enum is a console-based Win32 information enumeration utility.  Using
null sessions, enum can retrieve userlists, machine lists, sharelists,
namelists, group and member lists, password and LSA policy
information.  enum is also capable of a rudimentary brute force
dictionary attack on individual accounts.
