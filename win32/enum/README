  information.


Description:

  enum is a console-based Win32 information enumeration utility.
  Using null sessions, enum can retrieve userlists, machine lists,
  sharelists, namelists, group and member lists, password and LSA
  policy information.  enum is also capable of a rudimentary brute
  force dictionary attack on individual accounts.


Usage:

  enum <-UMNSPGLdc> <-u username> <-p password> <-f dictfile> <hostname|ip>

  -U  is get userlist
  -M  is get machine list
  -N  is get namelist dump (different from -U|-M)
  -S  is get sharelist
  -P  is get password policy information
  -G  is get group and member list
  -L  is get LSA policy information
  -D  is dictionary crack, needs -u and -f
  -d  is be detailed, applies to -U and -S
  -c  is don't cancel sessions
  -u  is specify username to use (default "")
  -p  is specify password to use (default "")
  -f  is specify dictfile to use (wants -D)
